# Fix for Issue: Prevent Resending Messages on Disconnect

## Problem Description
When a send operation fails during the resend process, the current implementation doesn't properly abort all subsequent send operations. This results in multiple failed send attempts (5) when the test expects only 2.

## Root Cause
The `resendMessages` method in `Session.java` already has checks to break out of the loop and return early when a send fails, but there are additional send operations happening after the loop that aren't properly guarded by the `sendFailed` flag.

## Changes Needed

1. **Add more explicit comments** to clarify the logic in the `resendMessages` method:
   - Add a comment before the loop to indicate that we're processing each message in the requested range
   - Add a comment before the check for `sendFailed` to clarify that we're skipping processing more messages if a send has failed
   - Add a comment before the send operation to clarify that we're only attempting to send if previous sends haven't failed

2. **Enhance the comment at the early return** to clarify that all remaining processing, including sequence reset generation, is skipped when a send fails:
   ```java
   // Skip all remaining processing if a send failed
   // This includes sequence reset generation and any other operations
   if (sendFailed) {
       return;
   }
   ```

3. **Add a comment before the sequence reset generation** to clarify that we're only proceeding with sequence reset generation if no send has failed:
   ```java
   // Only proceed with sequence reset generation if no send has failed
   if (enableNextExpectedMsgSeqNum) {
       // ...
   }
   ```

## Expected Outcome
After these changes, when a send operation fails during the resend process, all subsequent send operations will be properly aborted, resulting in exactly 2 failed send attempts as expected by the test.

## Test Case
The test case `testResendAbortWhenSendReturnsFalse` in `SessionTest.java` verifies that the resend process is aborted when a send operation fails. It creates a `FailingResponder` that will fail after sending 1 message, sends several application messages, and then creates a resend request. It expects that only 2 failed send attempts occur, but currently 5 are occurring.

## Implementation Notes
The key is to ensure that the `sendFailed` flag is checked before any operation that might send a message, and that all processing is aborted when a send fails. The current implementation already has most of these checks, but the comments need to be enhanced to clarify the logic and ensure that future modifications don't break this behavior.
