<h2>Customizing Message Code Generation</h2>
<p>
QuickFIX/J includes message libraries generated from standard FIX meta data. However,
there are several ways to customize code generation in QuickFIX/J.
</p>
<p>
The simplest customization is to just modify one or more data dictionaries
(e.g., FIX44.xml) and rebuild QFJ. This allows you to add custom fields,
define new messages not included in the specification, change whether fields
are required or optional, and so on.
</p>
<p>
You can also do more advanced customization by using the
<code>quickfix.codegen.MessageCodeGenerator</code> class. You can define
code generation tasks (<code>quickfix.codegen.MessageCodeGenerator.Task</code>)
that customize various aspects of the generation
process. The types of customizations currently supported include:
</p>

<table class="settings">
<tr>
	<th>Property</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>specification</td>
	<td>path to the XML file containing the FIX meta data (e.g. /my/dir/CUSTOM_FIX.xml)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>transformDirectory</td>
	<td>path to the XSLT transforms used to generate the message-related source code. Usually this
		will reference the standard QFJ XSLT templates in quickfix/codegen. However, you can
		modify the templates and put the modified templates wherever you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>outputBaseDirectory</td>
	<td>The base directory where generated source code will be placed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>overwrite</td>
	<td>Controls whether existings files are overwritten. Usually this would be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>messagePackage</td>
	<td>The Java package for the generated messages. This would be something like "my.message.fix42".
	In QFJ, for example, the package for the FIX 4.2 generated messages is "quickfix.fix42".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>fieldPackage</td>
	<td>The Java package for the generated field. This would be something like "my.message.fix42.fields".
	In QFJ, the fields are generated in the package "quickfix.fields" for all versions (newer versions
	overwrite older versions). By changing this property, you could generate fields into separate packages
	for each specification version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>orderedFields</td>
	<td>Generates message classes where regular (nongroup) body fields are ordered as specified in
	the meta. Although the FIX specification does not require this ordering, some exchanges do
	require it. There may be a slight (probably very slight) performance degradation when
	using this option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>decimalGenerated</td>
	<td>Generates BigDecimals for price, quantity, and similar fields. The default code
	generation generated doubles to be compatible with the QuickFIX C++ implementation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>utcTimestampPrecision</td>
	<td>The default UtcTimestampPrecision to be used during field code generation.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
To generate you own message library, you can create a program that uses the <code>MessageCodeGenerator</code>
to process the <code>Task</code> you have defined. Then use a simple Ant script to do the code
generation, compile the classes, and create a message JAR file. Depending on the type of customization
you've done, you may need to write a <code>MessageFactory</code> implementation, include that in the
JAR file, and then reference the factory in the session configuration. For Ant script examples, see
the QFJ core build scripts.
<p>
The most advanced customization is to modify the XSLT templates used to generate the
message source code. If you are interested in this level of customization, please look
at the XSLT template source code for more information.
