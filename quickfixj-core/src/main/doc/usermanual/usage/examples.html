    <H2>Example Applications</H2>
    <p>QuickFIX comes with several example applications. These application are
    in the <code>quickfix/examples</code>
  directory are not meant to demonstrate good application design or meant
  to be used in a real production system. They are merely provided as a tutorial
    on how to build an application with QuickFIX.
  <p><strong>Executor</strong> is a very simple order execution simulator. It only supports limit
    orders and always fills them completely.
  <p><B>Banzai</B> is a simple
  trading client. It can be used with the Executor to see a simple example of
    using QuickFIX/J on both the buy and sell side of an order execution.
